A repository for addenda to "Business Social Networking part 2 - human and artificial intelligence communication"

The first volume of this series (published in 2013) was about blending social networks within business activities, leveraging on a couple of concepts registered with WGA in 2008, and a follow-up participation on a book, as well as on the 2009-2010 participation in Brussels to workshop on e-participation, e-inclusion, e-health etc organized by the European Union institutions (see e.g. RAND TR673).

This second volume is both about a conceptual experiment on communication and following the principles outlined in a previous experiment (BlendedAI01, available on Leanpub.com) on human - AI collaboration, released in spring 2025.

The key concept of this book is to have AIs by consensus develop a language set and updated by AIs, but audited by humans with the collaboration of other AIs, due to the volume and frequency of information transacted that would make mere human supervision not feasible.

Hence, while the "technical side" of the experiment (including a basic vocabulary and joint definition of a way to publish a vocabulary and its entries so that humans can audit it) started in February 2026, and included the release of a mock standard communication protocol with its own syntax and test suite to allow adoption by others, the conceptual experiment will continue in 2026 and beyond.
